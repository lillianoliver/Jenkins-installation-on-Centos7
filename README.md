Jenkins is an open-source, Java-based automation server that offers an easy way to set up a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

Continuous integration (CI) is a DevOps practice in which team members regularly commit their code changes to the version control repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. 

Continuous delivery (CD) is a series of practices where code changes are automatically built, tested and deployed to production.
